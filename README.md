# 📘 Bhagavad Gita Chapter-wise Summary – Python Project

## 🕉️ About the Project

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that displays **chapter-wise summaries of the Bhagavad Gita** — one of the most profound and spiritual texts in Indian philosophy. The goal of this project is to **combine coding practice** with **spiritual learning**, making it a meaningful programming journey.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The user can **select a chapter number** (1 to 18).
- The program then displays a **brief summary** of that chapter.
- All summaries are stored in a dictionary or list format.
- Clean terminal-based interface using basic Python.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- Python basics: `functions`, `dictionaries`, `loops`, `input/output`
- Modular coding
- Data presentation using simple logic
- Real-world application of basic Python knowledge
